# PERFECT-EMPTY-DAPP
The perfect empty dapp code, ready to be used!

So you want to start building an ethereum dapp from scratch, and you need always the same things:

A] A basic page with header, body and footer.

B] A ready simple menu you can easy customize.

C] All basic Libraries you may need:

1. JQuery (millennials are using it less, but still it is very good and can do all you need cross platform)
1. Web3.js (in order to connect to blockchain)
2. blockies.js (in order to produce the nice Ethereum icons)
3. AlphaLayer.js (in order to detect wallet name and avatar image of the user)

D] Wallet Manager. (in order to select in real time your favorite wallet).

E] A Balance Viewer (included in the wallet manager, to see your balance in real time).

F] Transaction Manager (ready to verify in real time the status of your last transaction, triggering messages like: "You transaction was executed!").


All these things are trivial, unless you are a noob.

It took me a lot of time to get to this point.

I like to think that a noob will upload it on his server and in few minutes he can start his dapps without too many troubles.


The PERFECT EMPTY DAPP can be implemented with further libraries.

Please HELP ME TO HELP the community.


How can we transform it into a light client based dapp?

This is something I didn't have the time to study.

It is the missing step.

I hope I get your help, for any kind of implementation.

The PERFECT EMPTY DAPP is a free public project.

Just grab the code and enjoy.


Do you have more ideas?
